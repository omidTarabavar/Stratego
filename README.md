# Stratego

Course: Advanced Programming

This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Stratego game, created as part of the Advanced Programming course. Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and GUI development, I implemented a variety of features to enhance the player experience:

Load/Save Game: Players can save their progress or load a previously saved game.
AI Opponent: Play against a computer opponent in a strategic setup similar to chess.
Interactive Interface: The game includes a log window for gameplay warnings and logs, such as invalid moves and game results.
This project highlights my skills in Java, OOP design, and GUI development, providing a comprehensive gaming experience.
